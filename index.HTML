            Rafael Nadal, in full Rafael Nadal Parera, byname Rafa Nadal, (born June 3, 1986, Manacor, Mallorca, Spain),
            Spanish tennis player who emerged in the early 21st century as one of the game’s leading competitors,
            especially noted for his performance on clay. He won a record 14 career French Open championships, and his
            total of 22 Grand Slam men’s singles titles was tied for the most in tennis history.

            Nadal grew up in a sports-minded family; his uncle Miguel Angel Nadal was a professional association
            football (soccer) player who competed in the 2002 World Cup. Rafael began playing tennis at age four, guided
            by another uncle, Toni Nadal, who remained his coach on the professional tour. In his early years, Nadal
            (who wrote with his right hand) played left-handed tennis with both a two-handed forehand and backhand. When
            he was 12, however, his uncle encouraged him to adopt a more conventional left-handed style. Nadal stuck
            with his two-handed backhand but switched to what became his signature one-handed forehand, the stroke that
            was credited with lifting him into the sport’s upper echelons.
